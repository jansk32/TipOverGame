# TipOverGame

This an AI that implements an A-star Search to identify the moves taken to move a character from the start block to the finish block. This is based on a real-life puzzle game I used to play as a kid. Tip Over is a game developed by ThinkFun, where one has to tip over blocks in order to reach the finish block. The player can walk on any tile which consist of a block, but is not allowed to make diagonal moves. The current AI can solve Beginner levels rather quickly, but takes time for the more Advanced levels.
